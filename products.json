    "Description": "A High-Performance Luxury Class Gas Grill Built in the USA Heavy-duty 9mm cooking grates to create perfect sear marks Freedom of mobility as well as built-in storage and shelving provided by the grill cart Three red brass burners and ceramic briquette flame tamers produce consistent heat Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews The Estate Grill series includes full-featured luxury gas grills built in the USA. Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. The Estate propane grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Talk about grilling convenience! The Estate 42 Propane Grill Cart features magnetic access door with 2-drawer storage, 2 collapsible shelves, propane tank storage, interior door condiment tray, ventilation, and locking caster wheels. It arrivesfully assembled. Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA. There isn't a gas conversion kit available for AMG grills, but they make a natural gas version with the same price, specs and features, theESTF42-NG.

    "Description": "A High-Performance Luxury Class Gas Grill Built in the USA Heavy-duty 9mm cooking grates to create perfect sear marks Full-width hood handle and spring-assisted hood for easy grilling Three red brass burners and ceramic briquette flame tamers provide consistent heat Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews The Estate Grill series includes full-featured luxury gas grills built in the USA. Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. The Estate propane grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area of 900 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.

    "Description": "A High-Performance Luxury Class Gas Grill Built in the USA Heavy-duty 9mm cooking grates to create perfect sear marks Full-width hood handle and spring-assisted hood for easy grilling Three red brass burners and ceramic briquette flame tamers provide consistent heat Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews The Estate Grill series includes full-featured luxury gas grills built in the USA. Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area of 900 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.

    "Description": "A High-Performance Luxury Class Gas Grill Built in the USA Heavy-duty 9mm cooking grates to create perfect sear marks Freedom of mobility as well as built-in storage and shelving provided by the grill cart Three red brass burners and ceramic briquette flame tamers produce consistent heat Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews The Estate Grill series includes full-featured luxury gas grills built in the USA. Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Talk about grilling convenience! The Estate 42 Natural Gas Grill Cart features magnetic access door with 2-drawer storage, 2 collapsible shelves, tank storage, interior door condiment tray, ventilation, and locking caster wheels. It arrivesfully assembled. Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA.

    "Description": "A High-Performance Luxury Class Gas Grill Built in the USA Heavy-duty 9mm cooking grates to create perfect sear marks Full-width hood handle and spring-assisted hood for easy grilling Three red brass burners and ceramic briquette flame tamers provide consistent heat Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews The Estate Grill series includes full-featured luxury gas grills built in the USA. Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. The Estate propane grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area of over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist, and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA. The Estate 42 Built-in grill is 49.83-in wide, 29.61-in deep, and 25.45-in high. The Estate 42 grill requires a cutout 40.75-in wide, 21.625-in deep, and 10.25-in high. There isn't a gas conversion kit available for AMG grills, but they make a natural gas version with the same price, specs and features, theEST42-NG. If you are installing the grill into a combustible structure, or near combustible materials, we strongly recommend using an insulated grill liner,AMG model GL-EST42.Learn about Insulated Grill Jackets Product packaging, owners’ manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

    "Description": "The ultimate grilling experience with multi-fuel options Made in the USA with 304 grade stainless steel for longevity Classic, stylish design sure to be the centerpiece of your outdoor kitchen Seven stainless steel burners and flame tamers provide consistent heat Package Includes: Grill, Vinyl Grill Cover, Rotisserie Kit, Grate Lifting Tool, Stainless Steel Griddle, Drop-in Infrared Sear burner, Fuel Kit (Wood & Charcoal), Care Kit Best Gas Grills Made in the USA Best Outdoor Wine Coolers Best Built-In Gas Grills | Ratings & Reviews No other BBQ gives you multi-fuel flexibility in such a high-powered grill. The 54 Encore Hybrid grill delivers a whopping 176,000 BTUs of grilling power with over 1,600 square inches of cooking surface and leaves nothing to chance, with solid stainless steel construction and a load of included accessories. Why limit yourself to a single fuel type? With the AMG Encore Hybrid, you have your choice of propane, charcoal briquettes, lump charcoal, wood chunks, or hardwood pellets! With its creative Multi-Fuel Tray System, grilling with any combination of solid fuels places innovation in the hands of the BBQ chef. Note: While you can cook with pellets, the grill doesn't include a hopper/auger mechanism. You will be hard-pressed to find another grill designed to look like a classic muscle car. In fact, save your time. There aren't any (though this grill is also available in a 54 version!).
